Description: Miscellaneous printing of numeric or statistical results in R Markdown or Quarto documents according to guidelines of the "Publication Manual" of the American Psychological Association (2020, ISBN: 978-1-4338-3215-4). These guidelines are also referred to as APA style (<https://apastyle.apa.org/>) and contain specific rules on the formatting of numbers and statistical test results. The default output of numbers in the R console or R Markdown and Quarto documents does not meet the APA style requirements, and reformatting results manually can be cumbersome and error-prone. This package covers the automatic conversion of R objects to textual representations that meet the APA style requirements, which can be included in R Markdown or Quarto documents. It covers some basic statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, chi-squared test, Wilcoxon test) as well as some basic number printing manipulations (formatting p-values, removing leading zeros for numbers that cannot be greater than one, and others). Other packages exist for formatting numbers and tests according to the APA style guidelines, such as 'papaja' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=papaja>) and 'apa' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=apa>), but they do not offer all convenience functionality included in 'prmisc'. The vignette has an overview of most of the functions included in the package.
