Description: Miscellaneous printing of statistical results in
    Rmarkdown according to APA style guidelines. This package covers some
    basic statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, chi-squared test)
    and some basic number printing manipulations (formatting p-values,
    removing leading zeros for numbers that cannot be greater than one,
    and others).
