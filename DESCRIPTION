Description: Miscellaneous printing of numeric or statistical results in
    Rmarkdown or Quarto according to APA style guidelines. This package
    covers some basic statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation,
    chi-squared test) and some basic number printing manipulations
    (formatting p-values, removing leading zeros for numbers that cannot
    be greater than one, and others). Other packages exist for formatting
    numbers and tests according to APA guidelines, such as 'papaja'
    (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=papaja>) and 'apa'
    (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=apa>), but they do not offer all
    convenience functionality included in prmisc. The vignette has an
    overview of most of the functions included in the package.
