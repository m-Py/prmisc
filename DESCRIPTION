Description: Miscellaneous printing of numeric or statistical results in R Markdown or Quarto documents according to the "Publication Manual" of the American Psychological Association (2020, ISBN: 978-1-4338-3215-4). This package covers some basic statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, chi-squared test) and some basic number printing manipulations (formatting p-values, removing leading zeros for numbers that cannot be greater than one, and others). Other packages exist for formatting numbers and tests according to the style guidelines of the American Psychological Association, such as 'papaja' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=papaja>) and 'apa' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=apa>), but they do not offer all convenience functionality included in 'prmisc'. The vignette has an overview of most of the functions included in the package.
